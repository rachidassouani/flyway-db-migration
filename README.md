# Project Title
**flyway-db-migration**

# Introduction
Managing the state of your application (database) is a sometimes difficult, that why I believe database migration is an essential knowledge for any backend engineer.
In this demo project, I have created a simple example to deal with database migration using flyway dependencies.

# Technologies
Java 11, PostgreSQL, Flyway

# Setup
Since this is just  a simple demo maven project, all you need to do to run this project is :

- Create a new database, in my case I named it flywaydb (feel free to change the name in the application.java class)

- Before running the project in the main method that exists in the Application.java class, make sure that maven has downloaded all the required dependencies (PostgreSQL, flyway).

That's it!
